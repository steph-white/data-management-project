# NBA Team Comparison: Oklahoma City Thunder vs. Orlando Magic (2024–2025 Season)
This project analyzes game stats from the 2024-2025 NBA season, focusing on a comparison between OKC(the 2025 NBA champs and my favorite team, the Orlando Magic.

I accessed this data from Kaggle, which contains detailed player stats from each game played in the 2024-2025 NBA season

## Research Questions
1. **Scoring Efficiency:**  
   Did OKC average significantly more points per game than the Orlando Magic?

2. **Shooting Accuracy:**  
   Did OKC have a higher **field goal percentage (FG%)** and **three-point percentage (3P%)** than Orlando?

3. **Defensive Performance:**  
   How did OKC’s **steals** and **blocks per game** compare to Orlando’s?

   The tools I will be using includes:
   pandas - for data cleaning and manipulation (filtering by team and normalize stats per game)
   NumPy -- for calculations and descriptive stats (compare means and distributions across teams)
   Matplotlib/seaborn -- for data visualization (bar charts, box plots, and scatterplots to visualize differences)

   ## Expected Outcomes
   Identify specific performance areas where OKC and Orlando differ most.
   Identify what areas Orlando should improve in compare to OKC to have a shot at playoffs
